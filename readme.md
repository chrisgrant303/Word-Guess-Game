# JavaScript Assignment - Psychic Game | Chris Grant 2018 - August 5

### Overview
This is a very simple game that will have the computer generate a random letter and store it in a variable.  It will be up to the user to press alpha keys to see if they can match the same one stored by the computer.

There will be 9 guesses allowed.  If 9 guesses are completed without matching the variable stored in the computer, then a Loss will be registered, and the count will go up by 1.
